      <h2>About JayThom</h2>
      <p className='text-secondary'>
      Welcome to JayThom Custom Designs, your dedicated partner for small home repairs and remodels. <br/>
      My name is Jason, and I take pride in being a one-person team, ensuring that every project receives the personal attention it deserves. <br/>
      Drawing upon years of experience in carpentry and home remodeling, I specialize in services ranging from upgrades to finishes like trim and cabinetry to essential repairs such as damaged drywall and leaking plumbing. <br/> 
      What sets JayThom apart from large contractors is our ability to take on small jobs, offer services within days or weeks not months away, and I always try to only have one payment due at the very end of a project. <br/>
      As a valued client you will not have to worry about down payments or jobs that get started and stretched out for weeks. <br/>
      Your satisfaction is my priority, and I'm here to transform your vision into reality, one project at a time.
